; =============================================================================
; Custom PHP Configuration (Overrides)
; =============================================================================
; This file overrides the default php.ini settings inside the Docker container.
; It is mounted via docker-compose.yml to /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/uploads.ini
; =============================================================================

; 1. File Uploads
; Explicitly enable file uploads (usually On by default, but good to be sure).
file_uploads = On

; 2. Resource Limits
; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (64MB is sufficient for this blog).
memory_limit = 64M

; 3. Upload Size Limits
; Important: 'upload_max_filesize' controls the single file size.
; 'post_max_size' controls the total size of the POST request data.
; Both must be increased to allow larger image uploads (matching our 5MB logic + overhead).
; Note: This must also match or exceed 'client_max_body_size' in the Nginx config!
upload_max_filesize = 10M
post_max_size = 10M

; 4. Timeouts
; Maximum time in seconds a script is allowed to run before being terminated.
; Increased to 300s (5 min) to prevent timeouts during slow file uploads or database migrations.
max_execution_time = 300

; 5. Timezone
; Sets the default timezone used by all date/time functions (e.g. date(), strtotime()).
date.timezone = Europe/Berlin
